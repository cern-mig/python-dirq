Directory based queue.

A port of Perl module Directory::Queue
http://search.cpan.org/~lcons/Directory-Queue-1.3/

The goal of this module is to offer a simple queue system using the
underlying filesystem for storage, security and to prevent race
conditions via atomic operations. It focuses on simplicity, robustness
and scalability.

This module allows multiple concurrent readers and writers to interact
with the same queue.
