"""
QueueNull - object oriented interface to a null directory based queue.

A port of Perl module Directory::Queue::Null
http://search.cpan.org/dist/Directory-Queue/
The documentation from Directory::Queue::Null module was
adapted for Python.

=================
QueueNull class
=================

:py:class:`QueueNull` - null directory based queue.

Usage::

    from dirq.QueueNull import QueueNull

    # sample producer

    dirq = QueueNull()
    for count in range(1,101):
        name = dirq.add("element %i\\n" % count)


Description
-----------

    The goal of this module is to offer a "null" queue system using the
    same API as the other directory queue implementations. The queue will
    behave like a black hole: added data will disappear immediately so the
    queue will therefore always appear empty.

    This can be used for testing purposes or to discard data like one
    would do on Unix by redirecting output to */dev/null*.

    Please refer to :py:mod:`dirq.queue` for general information about
    directory queues.
